    <h1>Huourgtzel-Gleuuurffz</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A popular dessert, this dish is like citrus pudding with every known berry flavored tofu 
            balls floating inside. Its brilliant blue hue comes from the use of gleurts, a "baztul"
            (a species somwhere between an animal and a vegetable) from the planet "Blourltle". Blourltlians
            tend to eat it on their equivalent of earth's holidays, but don't let that stop you from 
            trying it out at your next party!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of blue gleurts</li>
            <li>4 cups of water</li>
            <li>1 tbsp kukuurix powder</li>
            <li>2 tbsp tarx powder</li>
            <li>1.5 cups plrubus seeds </li>
            <li>1 cup huourgtzel syrup (fresh squeezed is best!)</li>
            <li>2 cups of purple huourgtzels, chopped to your desired size</li>
            <li>Optional: Sugar, if the traditional Andromedan way is too tart for your human liking</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by placing the gleurts in the water to soak, for at least 6 hours. You may want to 
                leave them overnight for best results - however, do not leave longer than a day as they 
                can hatch if left in water too long (hatched gleruts are poisonous (and also venomous!)).
            </li>
            <li>After the gleurts have lost their color in the water, it should be smoking nicely and have taken
                on a bright blue hue. Pour the water slowly through a sive into a large bowl, collecting all of 
                the gleurts in the sive. Be sure to dispose of the gleurts properly so that they do not hatch 
                in your local water supply.  
            </li>
            <li>Add the kukuurix powder, the tarx powder, and the plrubus seeds. You should notice a thickening 
                of the mixture right away - the seeds are fast acting and will dissolve, but it is imperative you 
                do not touch them while they are working. Wait 10 minutes (15 may be better if your seeds are older,
                as they get more deadly with age), then gently shake the bowl to allow the mix to begin to coagulate
                well and for the kukuurix and tarx flavors to permeate the gelatinous mixture.
            </li>
            <li>Now that it's taken on a Jello-like look, gently drizzle on the huourgtzel syrup and allow it to 
                soak into the form. This should take a few minutes, but the gleuuurffz should take on an even brighter
                blue hue from being fed the syrup, and will become more complacent about your next steps.
            </li>
            <li>Taking your chopped huourgtzels, gently push them one at a time into the body of the gleuuurffz. DO NOT 
                push more than one in at a time - this will enrage the gleuuurffz, and cause it to turn a level of sour
                that the human mind cannot comprehend. Try to spread the huourgtzels out evenly, so that when biting into the 
                gleuuurffz later, you do not end up with parts that are overfilled or empty of their spongey texture.
            </li>
            <li>The gleuuurffz is now ready to serve - using the sharpest knife you have, cut it into several pieces, even
                if you are only planning to eat one right now (this is done to afford the gleuuurffz as little pain as
                possible). If the piece tastes too sour, you may add human sugar to the top.
            </li>
        </ol>
