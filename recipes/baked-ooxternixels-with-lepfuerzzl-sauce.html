    <h1>Baked Ooxternixels With Leffuerzzl-Sauce</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A water-based creature from the planet of Kupertinxlg, an ooxternixel is similar to an oyster if it
            had evolved vision. Featuring a flavor similar to earth's dolphin, the ooxternixel can be prepared
            with many different sauces, but the average Kupertinxlgen's favorite way to eat it is with a creamy
            leffuerzzl-sauce.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Enough ooxternixels for each person eating</li>
            <li>2 tbsp baztul</li>
            <li>2 tsp qlart paste</li>
            <li>3 tbsp ackleohn powder</li>
            <li>3 cups of kurlm</li>
            <li>1.5 tbsp poorkq</li>
            <li>1.5 cups of saz</li>
            <li>Garnish with a leafy vegetable, if desired</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350<sup>o</sup>.
            </li>
            <li>Place the ooxternixels evenly spaced in a baking dish. You will wbe tempted to remove their 
                ever searching eyes that are trying to make eye contact, but don't, as this will ruin the ooxternixel 
                flavor. Though they stare, this is a defense mechanism that cannot hurt you - their cousins, the 
                eexternixals are the ones that have developed mind control. Set in middle rack of oven for 45 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>In a sauce pan, melt the baztul and qlart paste together, then add the ackleohn powder and let it thicken.
                While you may feel dizzy if you stand too near as these ingredients blend together, this will pass within
                a few minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add the kurlm slowly while stirring.
            </li>
            <li>Once the sauce has finished thickening, add the poorkq and continue stirring, as this will prevent 
                it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. After 15 minutes, turn it off and let it set.
            </li>
            <li>Once the ooxternixels are done baking, remove them from the oven and let them cool slightly.
            </li>
            <li>Place as many ooxternixels as desired on a plate, and then slowly pour some of the saz over the top; 
                finish with a thick coating of the leffuerzzl-sauce, and garnish as desired.
            </li>
            <li>To eat, place ooxternixel in mouth and let it melt - this can take up to 15 minutes, but the flavor
                will stay as strong from the moment it is inserted into the mouth to the moment it disappears.
            </li>
        </ol>
